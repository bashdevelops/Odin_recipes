    <h2>Easy Spring Rolls Recipe</h2>
    <p>This is an easy spring roll recipe that I cook in an air fryer, but you could also cook it in the over. I like to serve it with sweet chile sauce.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak noodles in a bowl of hot water until soft, about 5 minutes. Cut noodles into shorter strands.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, mixed vegetables, onion, and garlic. Cook until beef is almost browned throughout, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in noodles; let stand until juices have been absorbed. Add soy sauce to the filling.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Lay out 1 egg roll wrapper onto a flat work surface; place a diagonal strip of filling across the wrapper. Fold the top corner over the filling; fold in the two side corners; brush center with cold water and roll spring roll over to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the spring rolls with vegetable oil. Arrange a batch of spring rolls into the basket of the air fryer; cook until crisped and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Repeat until all are cooked.</li>
    </ol>
